    "Music genre classification has a wide scope of applications and it has attracted the insterest of numerous researchers to tackle with the classification issue. Based on previous researches, machine learning techniques have proved to be able to identify trends from large pools of data, and ultimately classify the types of music. In this report, a music genre classification project is resolved based on a deep learning algorithm – Neural network. This project is developed in the python compiling environment and TensorFlow is applied as a tool. This paper first discusses the data source, including the class distribution and dimensionality analysis. Two models, Multilayer Perception (MLP) and Convolutional Neural network (CNN), were built to be trained in the project. The result of the two models was analyzed and evaluated for better performance. In the end, we suggest some methods for further improvement of classification.\n"

    "Categorizing music files according to their genre has been a challenging task in the area of music information retrieval (MIR) for its poorly defined concept and ever-increasing accuracy requirement (Bahuleyan, 2018). Additionally, it does find a wide range of applications in the real world along with the demand for more and more reliable and fast tools for content analysis and description to be used for searches, content queries, and interactive access. For instance, Spotify (which places recommendations based on genre classification to their customers) and Pandora (which generates images according to genre) (Haggblade et al., 2011) are both popular applications using the classification. Thus, it is important to explore an effective approach to address the categorizing problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "Since music genre classification is not a new problem in machine learning, many researchers have attempted to implement different types of algorithms to solve this problem. Among these approaches, Neural network is a classical method, which is exactly the one we applied in this project. Besides Neural network, many other methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) are also widely tested by expert programmers (Scaringella et al., 2006).\n",
    " \n",
    "To categorize by genre, music can be abstracted into a series of values based on universal features such as rhythm, form or timbre and then becomes a data point to be analyzed. In practice, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a popular way to concisely represent song waveforms (Ayush et al., 2017), which encodes the power spectrum of the sound with the calculation of the Fourier transform of the logarithm of the signal spectrum. Therefore, the experiment in this report also takes the MFCC value as a part of the features vector.\n",

    "In this report, music genre classification project is first implemented by MLP and then improved by CNN method. Additionally, the integral process of the experiment will be thoroughly discussed in this paper.\n",

    "The original data for the music genre classification project is a training dataset with 4363 songs, and a test dataset with 6544 songs. For each song, it has 264 features which contain Rhythm Pattern, Chroma and MFCCs information. The feature vector of each song consists of 264 dimensions: 168 values for the rhythm patterns (24 bands, 7 statistics), 48 values for the chroma (12 bands, 4 statistics), and 48 values for the MFCCs (12 bands, 4 statistics). Based on the data source, the goal of this experiment is to classify these songs into 10 possible classes, which is determined based on different music genres.\n",

    "During the early analysis stage, we found that the distribution of training dataset is extremely imbalanced. While the genre ‘Pop_Rock’ occupies approximately 50% of the dataset, the ‘Reggae’ and ‘Blues’ make up only around 2% of the whole set. Besides these three groups, data of other genres is also not balanced. In this case, we considered the performance of training may be affected for it may cause frustrating results. The frustrating results, which may turn out to be a lie of high accuracy, appears because some parts of the training set are perfectly trained whereas some are insufficiently trained due to the imbalance of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Neural network has attracted more and more attention in the last few decades because of its key advantages that make it most suitable for certain problems and situations. Firstly, Neural network is very powerful to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which is really crucial because in real-life, a great number of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear as well as complex. Secondly, unlike many other prediction techniques, Neural network does not impose many restrictions on the input variables. It gives the data scientist more flexibility to implement the tool.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this project, we used two types of Neural network—multilayer perception and convolutional Neural network. Multilayer perception is the one of the simplest Neural network. It consists of multiple neurons (nodes) arranged in layers. Nodes from adjacent layers have connections between them. All these connections have weights related to them. The layers can be divided into input layers, hidden layer, and output layer. Because the model contains one or more hidden layers, this type of Neural network is referred to as multilayer perception.\n",
    " \n",
    "CNN differs from MLP, because it takes advantage of local spatial coherence in the input variables (often images), which allows them to have fewer weights as some parameters are shared. This process makes them especially well-suited to extract relevant information at a low computational cost. \n",
    " \n",

    "For training with MLP model, the accuracies of training set and validation set are both better compared to the result in Kaggle. We think it is because the model is still not trained sufficiently due to imbalanced dataset. The log loss in Kaggle is much better than training set and validation set, which results from normalization in the evaluation process in Kaggle. Thus, the sum of the probabilities of each data sample is not equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same observation is obtained for CNN model. It gets similar result compared to MLP model. It does not exhibit better performance in spite of its advanced structure and concepts, which might be the reason that we still do not understand the concepts well and are not able to set up the optimal parameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss and accuracy of the dataset have a negative relation. As the training proceeds, the accuracy becomes higher, while the log loss becomes lower. Considering the definition of accuracy and log loss, it is not hard to understand the trends. When making the correct prediction on one set of music, the probability of the right label is the highest among all the labels. Thus the accuracy becomes higher and log loss becomes lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting result from the confusion matrix is that the model did not predict label 7 (International) for the validation set, which means the model is not able to learn the characteristic of this genre and make predictions on label 7. Besides this, the model makes some prediction on label 10. It is, however, not able to predict the result correctly. We assume the characteristics of label 10 is considerably similar to another types of music, so within this amount of training data, it does not have the ability to distinguish between this genre and other genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "These consequences can be traced back to the imbalanced training dataset. The more a specific group of data is, the greater effect it can impose on the model. For example, the data with label 1 has significant influence on the model, so it is clear from the confusion matrix that the model are more likely to make prediction on label 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the performance of the model, we have changed the method to split the dataset at the beginning of the processing, changed some parameters (number of layers, dense of each layer, dropout of each layer, batch size, kernel size, epochs) in the model, calculate the accuracy and log-loss. However, we have not been able to make huge progress compared to our first model. At that point, we realized the models we have built are not capable of handling the imbalanced dataset so we focus on resampling the data in the following update. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have attempted to implement random resampling and update the model by more balanced dataset. However, due to the limited time, we are not able to find the right approach to resample the data before submitting the report. The result is even worse compared to our previous submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future improvement, we will continue understanding the concepts and structure of Neural networks and try to test with more tunable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project, we have successfully implemented two neural networks models. In this project, we have successfully trained two neural network models, MLP and CNN, which are built with TensorFlow. We compared the results and analyzed and improved the performance of the two models. We passed the benchmark in Kaggle competition within three weeks, and continue optimizing the performance of the model. Throughout the project, we have gained a deeper understanding of how neural networks solve real-life problems and obtained some hands-on experience with popular frameworks and libraries.\n"
